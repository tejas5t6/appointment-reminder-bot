# 📅 Appointment Reminder Bot

## What is this project?
This project is a simple **Appointment Reminder Bot** created as part of the **GenZ for GenAI** program.

The idea is to help people remember their appointments by generating smart reminder messages based on basic appointment details and user preferences.

This is a **prototype project** that focuses on explaining the idea and workflow of a Generative AI system rather than building a full production application.

## Why is this needed?
Many people forget appointments such as doctor visits, meetings, or service bookings.  
This causes wasted time and inconvenience for both users and service providers.

A smart reminder system can reduce these problems by sending timely and personalized reminders.

## What does the bot do?
- Takes appointment details from the user
- Lets the user choose how and when they want to receive reminders
- Generates a reminder message automatically
- Shows a simple no-show risk level
- Allows the user to confirm, reschedule, or cancel the appointment (simulated)

## How does GenAI fit here?
This project is designed with **Generative AI (GenAI)** in mind.

In a real-world system, a Large Language Model (LLM) would:
- Understand appointment details and user preferences
- Generate natural and personalized reminder messages
- Optimize reminder timing and communication channel

For this submission, the GenAI behavior is **simulated** so that the complete workflow can be demonstrated without using real API keys.

## ScaleDown LLM (GenZ for GenAI)
Under the **GenZ for GenAI** program, the **ScaleDown LLM** can be used to power the intelligence of this system.

In a full implementation, appointment data would be sent to the ScaleDown LLM to generate optimized reminders.  
This project shows **where and how** that LLM would be used, but keeps the implementation simple and safe.

## Screenshots
Screenshots are included to show:
- Appointment input screen
- Generated reminder message
- Action buttons for confirmation and rescheduling

## Future improvements
- Real SMS and email notifications
- Calendar integration
- Full ScaleDown LLM API integration
- Better prediction of missed appointments

## Final note
This project is a **learning-focused prototype** created to understand how Generative AI can be applied to real-world scheduling problems.

It can be easily extended into a complete system with real AI and messaging integrations.
